    Upgrades ELK stack to 7.5 release. One path to completing this upgrade
    is to first upgrade Elasticsearch to 6.8 via Kolla custom config, and
    then finally remove the custom config to deploy the 7.5 release. See the
    `upgrade notes <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack/current/upgrading-elastic-stack.html>`__
    for more detail.
