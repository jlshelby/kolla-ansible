    Delegate executing ansible uri REST methods to service containers using
    kolla_toolbox. This will enable any certificates that are already copied
    and extracted into the service container to be automatically validated.
    This is particularly useful in the case that the certificate is either
    self-signed or signed by a local (private) CA.
